# What The Flexbox by Wes Bos

The course is available for free, here: https://flexbox.io/

I will use this repository to save the code <strong>I CREATE</strong>.
These are my solutions to the exercises in the course.


### Exercise01

A simple responsive navigation bar.

I also started using gulp with this exercise to autoprefix the css file(it wasn't needed, I decided to leave it in anyway).

---

### Exercise02

The responsive nav bar used in a simple site and collapsed into a menu when on the small screens.

---

### Exercise03

A semi responsive slide-show buttons.

---

### Exercise04

Simple Cards made with flex.

---

### Exercise05

Just a simple design to use up all the space available.

---

### Exercise06

A centered "search engine".

---

### Exercise07

A phone website with a top and bottom nav bars. Vertically responsive.

The course is done!
