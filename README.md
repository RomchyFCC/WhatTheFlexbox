# What The Flexbox by Wes Bos

The course is available for free, here: https://flexbox.io/

I will use this repository to save the code <strong>I CREATE</strong>.
These are my solutions to the exercises in the course.


### Exercise01

A simple responsive navigation bar.

I also started using gulp with this exercise to autoprefix the css file(it wasn't needed, I decided to leave it in anyway).
